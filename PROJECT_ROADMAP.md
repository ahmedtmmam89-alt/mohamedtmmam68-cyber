## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme (gray-900) with red-500 accents chosen for energy and focus
- **Icons**: Lucide React selected for consistent, modern iconography
- **Images**: Pexels stock photos for professional appearance
- **Animations**: Subtle slide-up and fade-in animations for smooth UX without distraction

### Technical Decisions
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **Database**: Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Hosting**: Vite for development, production-ready build
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useContext) - no Redux needed yet

### Business Logic
- **Membership Tiers**:
  - Normal ($99/mo): Weekly check-ins suitable for self-motivated clients
  - Premium ($199/mo): Daily monitoring for clients needing maximum support
- **Calorie Calculator**: Uses Mifflin-St Jeor equation (medical standard)
- **Food Plans**: Three clear goals (cutting/maintenance/bulking) with realistic targets
